Forget the pain and all the games we play
Forget the worry and the shame
I don't want no more
The gates of hell are waiting,
Let them wait a little more 

Where, where I go
My spirit is free, I'm coming home
Where, where I go
Remember me but let me go

With no regrets I lay down all my blame
The fate, the hate it's all the same
(You will become who you are)
I don't care no more
The gates of hell are waiting
Let them wait a little more

Where, where I go
My spirit is free, I'm coming home
Where, where I go
Remember me but let me go
