Forget the pain and all the games we play
Forget the worry and the shame
I don't want no more
The gates of hell are waiting,
Let them wait a little more 

Where, where I go
My spirit is free, I'm coming home
Where, where I go
Remember me but let me go

With no regrets I lay down all my blame
The fate, the hate it's all the same
(You will become who you are)
I don't care no more
The gates of hell are waiting
Let them wait a little more

Where, where I go
My spirit is free, I'm coming home
Where, where I go
Remember me but let me go

Senza rimpianti abbandono la colpa
Il destino e l'odio sono una cosa sola
I cancelli dell'inferno ci stanno aspettando
Lascia che attendano
Ovunque stia andando
Il mio spirito Ã¨ libero
Sto tornando a casa
Conserva il ricordo
Ma lascia che io vada

Where, where I go
My spirit is free, I'm coming home
Where, where I go
Remember me
Remember me
Remember me but let me go

I can feel I can fly
Where I go
I can feel I can fly
Where I go
